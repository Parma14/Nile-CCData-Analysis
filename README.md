Data-Driven Insights and Recommendations:

Address Billing Concerns: Given that billing questions dominate, streamline billing processes, enhance transparency, and provide comprehensive FAQs to address common billing issues proactively. Implement regular training for customer service agents on billing-related matters.
Proactive Root Cause Mitigation: Identify recurrent issues causing negative sentiments through root cause analysis. Implement preventive measures and proactive communication to minimize such problems, potentially incorporating self-service options for billing queries.
Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Focus on improving CSAT ratings by addressing negative sentiments. Conduct customer feedback surveys to understand specific pain points and areas needing improvement. Implement targeted improvements based on feedback.

Channel-Specific Strategies: Given the prevalence of calls, ensure the call center is adequately staffed and equipped. Leverage insights from other channels to optimize operations and enhance customer experience.
